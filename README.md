Website [https://wrijugh.github.io/web-students/](https://wrijugh.github.io/web-students/)

## Introduction

After successful **Python** [https://github.com/wrijugh/python-for-kids](https://github.com/wrijugh/python-for-kids) course last year this year (2021) I am thrilled to annouce the **Web** course for beginners.

<!-- I dedicate this to my father, who was a legendary teacher and lives in the hearts of many thousands of students worldwide. He was a lifelong passionate teacher. *I miss him dearly*. -->

In the world of internet Website is the way for us to interact. We use it often. But let us explore the basics of how to build such things. What all thing we need to know exits. My purpose is not to make someone an expert on them but ignite the idea and let them know about these options. That way if interested one would explore further. Developing Web is a lifelong exercise. There are new things we need to learn every now and then. So it is never ending. We need to start somewhere

Below is the high-level agenda I am planning to cover,

## HTML Basics

The heart and soul of Web

- [HTML Day 1](html/01-html-day-01.md) - few basic Tags
- [HTML Day 2](html/02-html-day-02.md) - more tags
