# Exploring Web Development for Yong Minds

In the world of internet Website is the way for us to interact. We use it often. But let us explore the basics of how to build such things. What all thing we need to know exits. My purpose is not to make someone an expert on them but ignite the idea and let them know about these options. That way if interested one would explore further. Developing Web is a lifelong exercise. There are new things we need to learn every now and then. So it is never ending. We need to start somewhere

Below is the high-level agenda I am planning to cover,

- [HTML Basics](html/html-00-index.md) - The heart and soul of Web
    WIP
- CSS Basics [Making Web beautiful]
- JavaScripts Basics [Programming for Web]
- Github Basics [to collaborate and keep your work safe]

At the end of this course you would be able to build a basic website and host in and share among your family and friends. Nothing is more pleasure than looking at your own creation live.
